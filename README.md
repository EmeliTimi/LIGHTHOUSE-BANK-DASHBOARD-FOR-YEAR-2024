Introduction

The Lighthouse Bank Churn Analysis Dashboard provides a data-driven view of customer attrition in 2024.
The dashboard analyzes churn behavior across age groups, gender, geography, and account balances to help the bank identify high-risk segments and improve customer retention strategies.












📂 Story of Data

The dataset represents simulated banking customer records designed to reflect real-world churn behavior.
Each record captures customer demographics, account status, and financial impact, enabling a holistic churn assessment.

Core fields include:

Customer Age Group

Gender

Country

Account Status (Active / Exited)

Account Balance

Churn Indicator















🔀 Data Splitting and Preprocessing

Before analysis, the data was prepared through:

Data cleaning and validation

Standardization of categorical variables (age groups, gender, country)

Separation of churned vs active customers

Aggregation of churn counts and churned balances

Creation of KPIs for total churn, average churned balance, and financial loss

















📊 Pre-Analysis

Initial exploration focused on:

Overall churn volume

Distribution of churn across age groups

Gender-based churn comparison

Country-level balance loss

This stage helped narrow the analysis to the most impactful churn segments.


















📈 In-Analysis

During analysis, the dashboard was used to:

Compare churned vs active members by age group

Identify the most churned age range

Analyze churn behavior by gender

Evaluate financial impact of churn across countries

Highlight top churned account holders by balance value

Interactive visuals allowed quick drill-down into high-risk customer segments.














🧠 Post-Analysis and Insights

Key insights from the dashboard include:

Customers aged 30–45 recorded the highest churn rate

Female customers experienced higher churn compared to males

Germany recorded the highest churned balance

A small group of customers contributed disproportionately to total balance loss












📉 Data Visualizations & Charts

The dashboard features:

Bar charts comparing churned vs active customers

KPI cards summarizing churn metrics

Donut chart showing churn by gender

Bar charts highlighting churned balances by country

Ranked list of top churned account holders

All visuals are dynamically connected for interactive analysis.













💡 Recommendations and Observations

Introduce targeted retention programs for customers aged 30–45

Investigate drivers of churn among female customers

Implement early-warning triggers for high-balance accounts

Strengthen customer engagement strategies in high-loss countries











🧾 Conclusion

The Lighthouse Bank Churn Dashboard delivers clear visibility into customer attrition patterns and financial risk.
By combining demographic, behavioral, and balance insights, the dashboard equips stakeholders with actionable intelligence to reduce churn and protect revenue.
